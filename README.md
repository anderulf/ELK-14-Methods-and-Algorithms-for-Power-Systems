# ELK-14: Methods and Algorithms for Power-Systems at NTNU

Specialization course for electric power engineering program

Cooperation with Trude Byre and Hilde Enevoldsen

## Assignments:
  **Assignment 1**: Newton-Raphson Load flow

  **Assignment 2**: Continuation Power Flow

  **Assignment 3**: Fast Decoupled Power Flow

  **Assignment 4**: Distribution Factors and Inverse Matrix Modification Lemma

  **Assignment 5**: Benders Decomposition - Optimal DC Power Flow

## How to navigate:
Run files are run to output different tasks and parts of each assignment

Methods and classes for each assignment are provided in the support.py files in the designated folders.

General methods and classes are supplied in supporting_methods.py and supporting_classes.py

Bus, Line, Jacobian, and Mismatch classes are used in most of the assignments so they are located in the supporting_classes.py.
The Load Flow class for newton raphson is located under the newton raphson folder. Contination and Fast_Decoupled uses the Load Flow class as a parent
